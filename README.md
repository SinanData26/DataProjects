# Data Projects to Showcase My Skillset

## Personal Project 1 - Europe Trip Spend Analysis
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate to prospective employers my skillset for a Data Analyst role. I have taken the initiative to create a personal project, with the objective of showcasing my proficiency and competency in EXCEL and SQL. I hope this project demonstrates not only my technical skills, but also my eagerness and proactive demeanour in taking on new challenges, which I believe are needed to be an ideal candidate.

Please feel free to download the Excel file and critique the project.Any and all feedback will be greatly appreciated.

## Personal Project 2 - Power BI Dashboard (Covid-19)

Similar to my previous project (see Europe Trip Analysis on my 'Feature Wall'), my objective is to showcase my technical skills as a Data Analyst, by taking the initiative to create an interactive dashboard in Power BI.

I wanted to sink my teeth into an interesting and engaging data-set to analyse. It had to be current, relevant and relatable. Which is why I chose to investigate the on-going pandemic that has dominated all our lives for the last few months. Specifically, the current situation in the city I live in, London. Therefore, I have taken this opportunity to provide informative insights into the effects of Covid-19 split by London's many boroughs, and how they compare with the rest of the regions in England.

The project is divided into 3 parts:
1. Project Introduction
2. Data Flow Diagram
3. Interactive Dashboard

Please feel free to explore and interact with the project via the buttons, and filter the data using the drop-down menus. A direct link to the Power BI dashboard can be found here: https://lnkd.in/dfikNpm
